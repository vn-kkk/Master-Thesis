"""
Tutorial to demonstrate running parameter estimation on a reduced parameter
space for an injected signal.

This example estimates the masses using a uniform prior in both component masses
and distance using a uniform in comoving volume prior on luminosity distance
between luminosity distances of 100Mpc and 5Gpc, the cosmology is Planck15.
