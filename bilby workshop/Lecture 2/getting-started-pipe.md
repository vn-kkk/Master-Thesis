# Getting started with bilby_pipe

This tutorial will go through using `bilby_pipe`, a tool for running analyses
at scale. `bilby_pipe` is not as flexible as `bilby`, but intended to do common
tasks.

All the files used are available in the repo [here](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/tree/master/pipe_examples) for future reference.

## Installation

* `bilby_pipe` is intended for use on either HTCondor or slurm clusters. You
can also use it on a local machine (running jobs serially). If you haven't
already, follow the [installation steps](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/blob/master/pages/installation.md) to make sure you have `bilby_pipe`
installed.
* To check it is installed, run
```bash
$ bilby_pipe --version
bilby_pipe=1.0.0 (CLEAN) ....
```

## Dependencies required for remote data access
* `bilby_pipe` uses the `gwpy`, `NDS2`, and `LDASTools-frameCPP` libraries to
  access LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data. To get full support, these need to be installed
via conda
```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge python-ldas-tools-framecpp python-nds2-client
```
If you don't install these, remote data access (i.e. not on a LIGO Data Grid
cluster) will be difficult.

## Basics

`bilby_pipe` operates through an `ini` file (also known as a configuration file). The `ini` file specifies **what** to run and **how**. To see all the available options for the `ini` file, you can run

```bash
$ bilby_pipe --help
```

You can also view this output [in the docs](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby_pipe/master/user-interface.html#bilby-pipe-help).

| :rocket: Task: run the `--help` command and check it produces output |

## The ini file: simple BBH simulation

An ini file consists of `key=value` pairs, a complete guide can be found [in the docs](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby_pipe/master/ini_file.html), here we will go through an example for a simulated signal.

### Ini file example
```
# The accounting tag, onnly needed on LDG clusters.
# See https://ldas-gridmon.ligo.caltech.edu/accounting/condor_groups/determine_condor_account_group.html
# for help with determining what tag to use
accounting = FILL_THIS_IN

# A label to help us remember what the job was for
label = bbh_injection

# The directory to store results in
outdir = outdir_bbh_injection

# Which detectors to use, option: H1, L1, V1
detectors = [H1, L1]

# The duration of data to analyse in seconds
duration = 4

# The sampler
sampler = dynesty

# The options to pass to the sampler
sampler-kwargs = {'nlive': 1000}

# The prior file to use
prior-file = bbh_simple_example.prior

# We want to inject a signal (in the case, drawn randomly from the prior)
injection = True

# We want to use Gaussian noise (default is to simulate it from O4-design sensitivity curves) 
gaussian-noise = True

# We'll do just one simulation
n-simulation = 1

# We'll run one "parallel" job. This runs n-parallel *identical* jobs and then combines the results together into a single combined run
n-parallel = 1

# Use parallisation using 4 cores on one node (remove comment to use)
# request-cpus = 4

```
| :rocket: Task: save the contents of the ini file above in a file `bbh_simple_example.ini` |
| --- |

### Parallelisation
As mentioned elsewhere, bilby supports a paralleisation up to the number of cores available a node. To access this, add the line
```
request-cpus = 4
```
You can check this is being applied by seeing this line in the logs:
```
Setting up multiproccesing pool with 4 processes.
```

### Prior file
Note, in the ini file, we specified `prior-file = bbh_simple_example.prior`, this is pointing to a file (you can specify and absolute or relative path as needed).
Here are the contents of that file, as you can see, this is a simple prior in only the distance and inclination
```
mass_1 = 50.0
mass_2 = 45.0
a_1 = 0.0
a_2 = 0.0
tilt_1 = 0.0
tilt_2 = 0.0
phi_12 = 0.0
phi_jl = 0.0
luminosity_distance =  bilby.gw.prior.UniformComovingVolume(name='luminosity_distance', minimum=1e2, maximum=5e3, unit='Mpc')
dec = -0.2
ra = 1.4
theta_jn = Sine(name='theta_jn')
psi = 0.0
phase = 0.0
geocent_time = 0.0
```

| :rocket: Task: save the contents of the ini file above in a file `bbh_simple_example.prior`. |
| --- |

### Ini file inputs
In the example above, we see a few different styles of input, let's briefly review them
* `key = value` (e.g, `sampler = dynesty`, `duration=4`, etc)
* `key = list` (e.g. `detectors = [H1, L1]`
* `key = dict` (e.g. `sampler-kwargs = {'nlive': 1000}`) note that the dictionary itself can handle lots of types of input.
* `key = boolean` (.e.g `gaussian-noise = True`)

### Running the example

If you followed the steps above, you should have two files stored `bbh_simple_example.ini` and `bilby_simple_example.prior`. If you do, you can run run bilby_pipe with the command

```bash
$ bilby_pipe bbh_simple_example.ini
```
This will produce the following output:

| :rocket: Task: run  `bilby_pipe bbh_simple_example.ini` and confirm you get output like that above |
| --- |

Note, this has **not** run or submitted the job, only created the files neccersery to do so. You should now see a directory `outdir_bbh_injection` with several sub-directories:
```bash
$ ls outdir_bbh_injection/
data  log_data_analysis  log_data_generation  log_results_page  result  results_page  submit  bbh_injection_config_complete.ini
```
Except the `submit` directory, these will be empty right now and populated one the run starts. Let's look in the `submit` directory
```bash
$ ls outdir_bbh_injection/submit/
bash_bbh_injection.sh  # <- This is a bash file containing all the commands to run different parts of the job locally
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty.submit  # <- This is a HTCondor submit file for the analysis step
bbh_injection_data0_0_generation.submit  # <- This is a HTCondor submit file for the analysis step
dag_bbh_injection.submit  # <- This is the HTCondor dag submit file
```

### Submitting the job: HTCondor
If you are running things on a HTCondor cluster, you can now submit the job with
```bash
$ condor_submit_dag outdir_bbh_injection/submit/dag_bbh_injection.submit
```
Alternatively, you can submit things when you run `bilby_pipe` by adding the `--submit` flag, i.e.
```bash
$ bilby_pipe bbh_simple_example.ini --submit
```

### Submitting the job: Slurm
As you'll notice, the **default** in bilby pipe is to use the `HTCondor` scheduler (this is the standard on all LDG clusters). If you are on a Slurm cluster, you need to **add** some lines to the ini file, a detailed discussion of these can be found [in the documentation](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby_pipe/1.0.1/user-interface.html#using-the-slurm-batch-scheduler), but will depend on your cluster setup.

### Submitting the job: local
All bilby_pipe jobs can be run on your local machine. There are two ways to do this
#### 1. Using the `--local` flag
You can run 
```
$ bilby_pipe bbh_simple_example.ini --local
```
This will run each step of the job sequentially on your local machine
#### 2. Using the bash file
Let's look inside the `bash` file
```bash
$ cat outdir_bbh_injection/submit/bash_bbh_injection.sh 
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# bbh_injection_data0_0_generation
# PARENTS 
# CHILDREN bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty
/home/user1/anaconda3/envs/bilby/bin/bilby_pipe_generation outdir_bbh_injection/bbh_injection_config_complete.ini --label bbh_injection_data0_0_generation --idx 0 --trigger-time 0 --injection-file outdir_bbh_injection/data/bbh_injection_injection_file.dat

# bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty
# PARENTS bbh_injection_data0_0_generation
# CHILDREN 
/home/user1/anaconda3/envs/bilby/bin/bilby_pipe_analysis outdir_bbh_injection/bbh_injection_config_complete.ini --outdir outdir_bbh_injection --detectors H1 --detectors L1 --label bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty --data-dump-file outdir_bbh_injection/data/bbh_injection_data0_0_generation_data_dump.pickle --sampler dynesty
```
This contains the set of instructions to run each step of the job. You can run this directly, i.e. with
```bash
$ bash outdir_bbh_injection/submit/bash_bbh_injection.sh
```
Or you can copy parts of the file you want to run to a separate script and run each one individually (this is often very useful if you **just** want to run a step locally, i.e. the plotting).
| :rocket: Task: the example script using *either* the `--local` flag or the bash file |
| --- |

### Looking at the outputs
Once you have run the example to completion, we should check the outputs. If you ran using either `slurm` or `HTCondor` the `log*` files will be populated with files containing the run outputs. If instead you ran it locally, this output would have been printed to the terminal.

#### The dynesty output
If you are using the dynesty sampler, you'll get output like this (either in the logs, or printed to the terminal)
```
136it [00:04,  4.57it/s, bound:0 nc:  1 ncall:6.6e+02 eff:20.7% logz-ratio=146.11+/-0.13 dlogz:321.891>0.1]
151it [00:04,  6.44it/s, bound:0 nc:  3 ncall:6.8e+02 eff:22.3% logz-ratio=151.24+/-0.13 dlogz:316.951>0.1]
169it [00:04,  9.05it/s, bound:0 nc:  1 ncall:7.0e+02 eff:24.1% logz-ratio=155.53+/-0.13 dlogz:312.568>0.1]
185it [00:04, 12.54it/s, bound:0 nc:  1 ncall:7.3e+02 eff:25.3% logz-ratio=160.67+/-0.14 dlogz:307.518>0.1]
203it [00:04, 17.38it/s, bound:0 nc:  1 ncall:7.5e+02 eff:27.0% logz-ratio=168.88+/-0.14 dlogz:299.232>0.1]
```
By column, this tells you: 
* `203it`: the number of iterations
* `00:04`: the time taken so far (note if jobs are restarted this counter is reset to zero)
* `17.38it/s`: the number of iterations per second
* `bound:0`: the bound index (see [dynesty docs](https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html))
* `nc:  1`: the number of likelihood calls used in the last iterations
* `ncall:7.5e+02`: the total number of calls
* `eff:27.0%`: the sampling efficiency 
* `logz-ratio=168.88+/-0.14`: the current logz-ratio estimate (if > 0, this is a Bayes factor in support of the signal hypothesis vs. Gaussian noise)
* `dlogz:299.232>3` the estimated remaining evidence and threshold (in this instance, 0.1). Sampling will finish when `dlogz` is less than the threshold.

Roughly speaking `logz-ratio + dlogz` is an estimate of the final evidence, but note that `dlogz` can jump if new regions of the parameter space are found with high likelihoods.

#### Output files
In the `results` directory, we have all of the relevant output:
```bash
$ ls outdir_bbh_injection/result
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty_result.json  # <- THIS IS THE MAIN RESULT FILE
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty_dynesty.pickle  # <- A python pickle file of the dynesty sampler output
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty_resume.pickle  # <- A python pickle file used to store results during the run
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty_samples.dat  # <- A set of samples created during the run, not the final output
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty_checkpoint_run.png 
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty_checkpoint_stats.png
bbh_injection_data0_0_analysis_H1L1_dynesty_checkpoint_trace.png
```
The last three `png` images contain diagnostic plots. These will be updated during the run and help show the progress

#### The run plot

## Priors

As seen above, you can specify your own prior using a prior file. `bilby_pipe` also provides a set of default prior files based on the duration of data. These are:
* [4s](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby_pipe/-/blob/master/bilby_pipe/data_files/4s.prior)
* [8s](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby_pipe/-/blob/master/bilby_pipe/data_files/8s.prior)
* [16s](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby_pipe/-/blob/master/bilby_pipe/data_files/16s.prior)
* [32s](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby_pipe/-/blob/master/bilby_pipe/data_files/32s.prior)
* [64s](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby_pipe/-/blob/master/bilby_pipe/data_files/64s.prior)
* [128s](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby_pipe/-/blob/master/bilby_pipe/data_files/128s.prior)

The chirp-mass range ensures that the signals fit within the data duration. To use these default priors, simplify specify
```
prior-file=4s
```

## Accessing data

If you want to access data, you'll need to specify a `trigger-time` (a GPS time as used by LIGO/Virgo) and the `channel-dict` used to determine *which* data to use. Here is an example ini file for running on GW150914
```
# The accounting tag, onnly needed on LDG clusters.
# See https://ldas-gridmon.ligo.caltech.edu/accounting/condor_groups/determine_condor_account_group.html
# for help with determining what tag to use
accounting = FILL_THIS_IN

# A label to help us remember what the job was for
label = GW150914

# The directory to store results in
outdir = outdir_bbh_gwosc_GW150914

# Which detectors to use, option: H1, L1, V1
detectors = [H1, L1]

# The duration of data to analyse in seconds
duration = 4

# The sampler
sampler = dynesty

# The options to pass to the sampler
sampler-kwargs = {'nlive': 1000}

# The prior file to use
prior-file = 4s

# For events, we can pull in the time using a string
trigger-time = GW150914

# You could alternatively do (uncomment to test)
# trigger-time = 1126259462.4

# Here we specify the GWOSC channel, if you want to use a different channel
# you can pass that per-detector
channel-dict = {H1:GWOSC, L1:GWOSC}
```

:warning: Warning: running the ini file above will take ~ 12hrs as it is a full analysis of GW150914

## Inject a signal into real data

```
# The accounting tag, onnly needed on LDG clusters.
# See https://ldas-gridmon.ligo.caltech.edu/accounting/condor_groups/determine_condor_account_group.html
# for help with determining what tag to use

# A label to help us remember what the job was for
label = gwosc_injection

# The directory to store results in
outdir = outdir_bbh_gwosc_injection

# Which detectors to use, option: H1, L1, V1

# The options to pass to the sampler
sampler-kwargs = {'nlive': 1000}

# The prior file to use

```

:warning: take care to make sure the `geocent_time` of the injection falls within the prior window (+/- 0.2 around the `trigger_time`)

Running this, you can check estimated SNR of the injected signal in the logs, e.g.

```
12:53 bilby INFO    : Injected signal in L1:
12:53 bilby INFO    :   optimal SNR = 13.28
12:53 bilby INFO    :   matched filter SNR = -3.65+38.02j
```

:warning: Warning: running the ini file above will take ~ 12hrs as it is a full analysis of THE INJECTED SIGNAL

## Power Spectral Densities

### Setting the PSD using a file
```
psd-dict PSD_DICT   Dictionary of PSD files to use (default: None)
```
e.g.
```
psd-dict = {H1:psds_files/h1.psd}
```

### Estimating the PSD from the data
If no PSD is given, one will be estimated from the data. Note this differs to standard LVK analyses which use a BayesWave generated PSD. Here are the options to control how that PSD is estimated.
```
  --psd-fractional-overlap PSD_FRACTIONAL_OVERLAP
                        Fractional overlap of segments used in estimating the
                        PSD (default: 0.5)
  --post-trigger-duration POST_TRIGGER_DURATION
                        Time (in s) after the trigger_time to the end of the
                        segment (default: 2.0)
  --sampling-frequency SAMPLING_FREQUENCY
  --psd-length PSD_LENGTH
                        Sets the psd duration (up to the psd-duration-
                        maximum). PSD duration calculated by psd-length x
                        duration [s]. Default is 32. (default: 32)
  --psd-maximum-duration PSD_MAXIMUM_DURATION
                        The maximum allowed PSD duration in seconds, default
                        is 1024s. (default: 1024)
  --psd-method PSD_METHOD
                        PSD method see gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.psd for
                        options (default: median)
  --psd-start-time PSD_START_TIME
                        Start time of data (relative to the segment start)
                        used to generate the PSD. Defaults to psd-duration
                        before the segment start time (default: None)
```
